This is @Bram__ , @rrooding , @gertgoet en @micheldegraaf's entry for Eindhoven.rb Hackathon,march 2012.

In 3 hours we made a webapp that allows you to troll your fiends by entering the victims phone number and sending them a generated URL.
When the opens the URL he/she will see a short creepy clip of the movie "The ring" and he will then recive a phone call that will notify him that he has "seven days" left to live.

This app is build with:
- Rails 3
- MongoDB
- Twillo (for VOIP)
